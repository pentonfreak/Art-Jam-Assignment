# Art-Jam-Assignment
Khuong's Art Jam assignment - date due 30/9/2025

For variables, I did use "const" and "let".
For use interaction, I made the pupils to follow the mouse.
Me as a beginner of javascript, there quite a few things that are new to me: "for" and "let", "ctx", "return", "Math.round", "Math.min", "Math.squrt".
For conditionals, I did use "if", maybe there's more but that's all I know.

I would like to explain my code:

- TILE_SIZE: Size of each grid square in pixels.
- COLS/ROWS: Number of columns and rows in the grid.
- WIDTH/HEIGHT: Total canvas size in pixels.
